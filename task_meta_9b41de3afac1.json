  "prompt": "You are implementing a project called \"improved docs for agent coding\".\n\n# Project Plan\n\nThere should be a PLAN.md (or plan.md) file in the root of this repository\ncontaining the full project plan. **Read it first** to understand the overall\ngoals, architecture decisions, and how your current work fits into the\nbigger picture.\n\nIf PLAN.md is not present, here is the full plan for reference:\n\n<project-plan>\nImprove the agent system documentation to make development easier for both human and AI developers. Focus on creating comprehensive feature documentation that provides quick, contextual access to relevant information when working on specific features or components.\n\nDesign Principles:\n1. Hierarchical organization: Top-level overview \u2192 component-specific \u2192 feature-specific\n2. Progressive disclosure: Quick reference at top, details below\n3. Agent-friendly formatting: Clear section headers, tables, code examples with context\n4. Cross-referencing: Link related docs explicitly\n5. Location awareness: Each doc states its scope and related files\n6. Searchability: Consistent naming conventions, keywords in headers\n\nTarget Audiences:\n1. AI agents (primary): Working on specific features, need fast context access\n2. Human developers (secondary): Understanding system architecture, adding features\n3. New contributors: Getting started, understanding conventions\n</project-plan>\n\n---\n\n# Your Tasks\n\nImplement ONLY the following tasks. Do not work on tasks from other phases.\nCommit after completing each logical unit of work with clear messages referencing the phase/task.\nRun any existing tests after your changes to make sure nothing is broken.\n\n## Phase 1: Documentation Architecture & Core Structure\n\nEstablish the foundational documentation structure with hierarchical organization, progressive disclosure principles, and agent-friendly formatting conventions.\n\n### Task: Design hierarchical documentation architecture\n\nCreate a comprehensive documentation structure that follows the top-level overview \u2192 component-specific \u2192 feature-specific hierarchy. Design the progressive disclosure system where quick reference information appears at the top with detailed information below. Establish consistent naming conventions and keywords for headers to support searchability.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** Documentation architecture designed with clear hierarchy from overview to feature-specific\nProgressive disclosure system implemented with quick reference at top and details below\nConsistent naming conventions and header keywords established for searchability\nAgent-friendly formatting standards defined with clear section headers, tables, and code examples\nLocation awareness system designed where each doc states its scope and related files\n\n### Task: Create top-level overview documentation\n\nDevelop comprehensive system overview documentation that provides high-level understanding of the agent system architecture. Include system-wide concepts, core principles, and navigation guides for both AI agents and human developers.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** System overview documentation created covering architecture and core principles\nNavigation guides provided for AI agents and human developers\nCross-referencing system implemented to link related documentation explicitly\nTarget audience-specific entry points established for AI agents, human developers, and new contributors\nQuick access patterns documented for contextual information retrieval\n\n\n## Instructions\n- Read PLAN.md first for full context about the project design and goals.\n- Implement ONLY the tasks listed above under 'Your Tasks'.\n- Within each phase, implement tasks in the order listed.\n- Make sure all tests pass before finishing.",
