  "prompt": "You are implementing a project called \"Give agent some branding\".\nImplement ALL of the following phases and tasks in order.\nCommit after completing each logical unit of work with clear messages referencing the phase/task.\nRun any existing tests after your changes to make sure nothing is broken.\n\n## Design Document\n\nTransform the Agent Portal frontend into a branded, visually appealing web application suitable for public hosting at agent.danvan.xyz. The project currently lacks a cohesive identity and needs professional branding that communicates its core value proposition: a modular LLM agent framework.\n\nBrand Identity: ModuFlow (Modular Agent Flow) with tagline 'Your Modular AI Agent Framework'. Professional yet approachable personality with modern, tech-forward design.\n\nVisual Identity: Keep existing indigo (#6366f1) as primary, add teal/cyan (#06b6d4) as secondary. Dark theme foundation with Inter font. Logo concept: abstract geometric representation of connected modules.\n\nTech Stack: React 19.0.0 with TypeScript, Vite 6.0.0, Tailwind CSS 3.4.17, existing OAuth authentication. Current domain: agent.danvan.xyz\n\n## Phase 5: Polish & Refinement\n\nAdd final touches including component audit, animations, accessibility improvements, and performance optimization.\n\n### Task: Audit All UI Components\n\nReview all pages for 'Agent Portal' references, ensure consistent color usage, verify responsive behavior across all components.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** No 'Agent Portal' text remains, colors follow palette, all pages are mobile-friendly\n\n### Task: Add Loading States & Animations\n\nCreate branded loading spinner with logo, implement smooth transitions between routes, add skeleton loaders with brand colors.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** Loading states feel polished, animations are smooth and not jarring\n\n### Task: Accessibility Audit\n\nVerify color contrast ratios (WCAG AA), add ARIA labels where needed, test keyboard navigation, test screen reader compatibility.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** All text meets contrast requirements, keyboard navigation works throughout, screen readers announce content properly\n\n### Task: Performance Optimization\n\nOptimize logo SVG file size, lazy load Inter font, preload critical assets, optimize bundle size for faster loading.\n\n**Acceptance criteria:** Lighthouse score > 90, first contentful paint < 1.5s, logo/fonts don't cause layout shift\n\n\n## Instructions\n- Work through each phase sequentially.\n- Within each phase, implement tasks in the order listed.\n- Make sure all tests pass before finishing.",
